# Stats

`Giggly.Stat` runs a layer's statistical transformation on its table. Why the identity is a stat a
layer names rather than an absence: design-log §4, the entry beginning "A layer names its stat and
position"; why the layer records a struct of its kind, run through a protocol at the root:
the entry beginning "Each facet, coordinate system, geom, stat and position is a struct".

## Rules

- **A layer always records its stat, the identity included.** An absent stat cannot be told from
  a forgotten one; `%Stat.Identity{}` says the layer computes nothing on purpose, and a test can
  say so.
- **A layer records its stat as a struct of its kind, which `Plot` builds and never runs.** `Plot`
  lists this boundary to build the struct; `GigglyCredo.Check.PlotRunsNothing` keeps the protocol
  out of its files. Each stat is one module holding its struct, whose fields are its parameters,
  and its computing, in a `defimpl` that opens by classifying itself into this boundary; the
  boundary exports the kinds.
- **A stat runs after the position scales have mapped the layer's x and y columns**, so it
  computes on positions: a discrete value is its level's position.
- **A stat's arguments arrive with their first reader.** The identity is handed the table alone.
  The panel's scales (ggplot2 hands `compute_layer` the layout, and binning reads the scale's
  range), the split by panel and by group, and ggplot2's rule for carrying a group's constant
  columns through a summary arrive with the first stat that computes.
