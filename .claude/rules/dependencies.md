# Dependencies, toolchain, lint and security waivers

Taking any dependency update: the `dependency-updates` skill (read the package diff, never trust
semver or the changelog).

## Rules

- **A new lint or security waiver stops and asks the user.** Before adding a
  `credo:disable-for-*`, or a `hex.audit` ignore, ask whether the code needs the flagged construct
  at all: a shell-out where the standard library has the function, an interpolated query where a
  bound parameter would do. If it does, two lines sit directly above the waiver, and the review
  report carries the same three answers:
  ```elixir
  # why: <what the code needs that trips the tool, and the invariant that keeps it safe>
  # instead of: <the alternative considered> — rejected because <reason>
  ```
  `.claude/hooks/waiver-gate.sh` denies the edit until both are there, then asks the user to
  approve with the diff in view; the commit gate re-checks the diff. **A marker quoted inside a
  `"""` heredoc is prose, not a waiver**, and both scanners skip it — documenting the invariant
  that keeps a waiver safe in a moduledoc is the pattern here, so a moduledoc explaining one must
  not read as one. An internal module's documentation is a comment, where a quoted marker would
  read as a waiver, so it explains its waiver without quoting one. A waiver whose rejected
  alternative was cheaper than the waiver is a finding on the construct, not the comment
  (`elixir-code-review`, `references/suppressions.md`). Scope a
  waiver as narrowly as the tool allows; a `.credo.exs` check moved to `disabled:` silences code
  not yet written.
- **The exact Elixir/Erlang toolchain is pinned in `.tool-versions`**, and CI reads it from there
  (`erlef/setup-beam` with `version-file`), so there is one place to bump. A Dockerfile, when one
  exists, is the second place and moves with it.
- **New credo checks are adopted deliberately through `.credo.exs`'s `enabled:` allowlist**, not by
  plugin default. The `ex_slop` plugin's recommended set is appended from the package so it stays
  in step; everything else is listed by hand.
- **Repo-local checks live in `.credo/checks/`, and each one makes a rule this repo already states
  in prose into a gate failure.** They are loaded by `.credo.exs`'s `requires:` and enabled one at
  a time like any other check. Outside `lib/` deliberately: `lib/` compiles into the release, a
  dev-only lint has no business there, and a check under `lib/` would want a boundary declaration
  and count against `rules_check`'s uncovered-file budget. The checks the harness ships
  (`Tack.Credo.Check.*`) come from the package instead and need no copy. Four things hold
  a new local check together:
  **(1) A rule the `boundary` compiler already holds is not restated** — a web module naming
  `Repo`, a core module calling a context. Two homes for one rule is one home too many, and the
  compiler's home is the stricter of the two. What credo is for is what Boundary cannot see: the
  **standard library** inside the pure core (`DateTime.utc_now/0`, `Application.get_env/3`,
  `spawn/1` are `:elixir`/`:kernel`, so a core module calling one compiles in silence), and
  conventions with no type-level shape at all.
  **(2) Scoping lives in `.credo.exs`**, in the check's `files:` filter with its reason beside it,
  never inside the check — so the exemption list reads next to every other piece of configuration.
  A per-check `excluded:` **string** is resolved as a file or a directory, not as a path prefix
  (`Credo.Sources.find_in_dir/3`), so a directory name silently leaves the `.ex` beside it in
  scope — use a regex. The file is evaluated as Elixir, so a check's parameter may be *derived*
  from the code rather than restated; guard any such call with `Code.ensure_loaded?/1` and
  **raise**, because `mix credo` requires only `loadpaths` and a cold `_build` has nothing to call
  — a fallback list would be the silent under-enforcement the derivation exists to avoid. **A
  single sanctioned site is waived inline instead**, at the code, where the `# why:` line names
  why it is sanctioned and the hook makes the next one a decision.
  **(3) Each check is tested in both directions**: a check that fires on everything and a check
  that fires on nothing both pass a one-sided test, and the second failure is the silent one — a
  rule that quietly stopped being enforced. One test file, `test/credo_checks_test.exs`,
  `Code.require_file`s the local checks, and only one may, since requiring the same source twice in
  one VM redefines the module and the warning fails the gate; it starts the `credo` application
  itself, since credo is a `runtime: false` dependency whose parsing services nothing else starts.
  An issue's place is asserted too, its line, column and trigger: credo finds the column by
  searching the reported line for the trigger, so a trigger that is not on that line leaves the
  issue pointing at no column, and nothing else would notice.
  **(4) Size a candidate check by running it, scoped as its nearest sibling is, never by grep.** A
  grep over-reports twice over: it ignores the scoping the check will take, and it matches prose,
  including the header comments that document the very rule being counted.
- **`boundary` is the one dev tool that is not `only: [:dev, :test]`**, and must stay that way: it
  is a compiler, so it has to exist wherever `mix compile` runs, including a `:prod` release
  build. Scoping it away from prod makes the release build fail on an unknown compiler.
- **`muex` is pinned exactly (`==`), not with `~>`.** It is young and releases fast, and the
  flags in `elixir-code-review`'s `references/mutation-testing.md` exist because its defaults give
  a confident false pass. So a bump goes through `dependency-updates` like any other, and before
  the step is trusted again it re-checks what the new version does by default: which mutants the
  optimizer drops, which modules the filter skips, how `--files` is read, and that each mutant is
  still built from source in a sandbox of its own and run in a fresh VM, so none reuses another's
  build.
- **A boundary declaration is a layering decision, so widening one asks the user** — the same
  standing as a lint waiver, but enforced **harder**: `.claude/hooks/waiver-gate.sh` scores each
  declaration's grants and **always denies** an edit that raises the score. An Edit is scored
  against the **whole file** it would leave, not its fragments, since a formatted declaration keeps
  its `exports:` list on the lines below `use Boundary,` and a fragment holding only list entries
  would otherwise score nothing. **Removing a declaration is a widening too**, though the score reads
  it as 0 → 0 (a boundary exporting only its root scores 0, and so does no declaration): it folds
  the boundary's modules into the parent, where anything may call them. So the hook also counts
  declarations and denies a drop, and the commit gate flags a declaring file deleted while modules
  remain under its namespace — deleting the whole namespace widens nothing. No comment satisfies
  the deny, and the commit gate re-scans the working tree so a Bash edit cannot slip past.
  Narrowing is always free. Two gentler designs fail
  the same way: `ask` is auto-approved by the session's permission mode, so the widening reaches
  nobody; and a required `# why:` comment is the agent writing a justification, meeting its own
  rule with it, and approving it — a control with no second party. So the explanation belongs
  **in conversation with the user, in plain language**: which list grew, which module joined it,
  what can now call what, and whether changing the *caller* was the alternative. One widening per
  ask, never a batch: the interruption is the control. A forbidden-reference warning usually means
  a caller is reaching past a seam, not that the seam is too tight. **The score is a proxy; relay
  the deny message's caveats with it.** When a change also adds or removes an option the score
  does not read (`type:`, `top_level?:`, `check:`, `dirty_xrefs:`), or involves `exports: :all`
  — which the score ranks as maximal even on a nested boundary — the message says so, and the
  explanation to the user must cover the whole change, not the number. **Move a declared file with
  `git mv`**: the commit check pairs a staged rename and scores it against its old declaration,
  while a plain `mv` reads as a new file whose every grant is new.
- **A change to a hook is written as a patch, tested on a copy, and applied by the user.** Claude
  Code's auto mode may refuse the agent's edit to `.claude/hooks/waiver-gate.sh`; revert any
  half-made edit, never leave the hook between states. Prove the patch on a copy (or a throwaway
  clone, where staging, approving and committing touch no real marks) with a case that must pass
  and one that must still be stopped.
- **`exports: :all` is for the umbrella root only.** On a sub-boundary the list is written out one
  module at a time, because the list is an approval gate, not bookkeeping: an explicit list fails
  **safe** — a new module is private until a person admits it — while `:all` makes it public the
  moment it compiles. The hook scores a listed module at 1 and a bare `:all` at 1000, so the mass
  form on a sub-boundary is denied outright. The generated boundary declarations test pins this.
- **Moving a module between boundaries is a grant too.** A mix task belongs to no architectural
  tier, so `classify_to:` assigns it to one by hand — and changing that target changes what the
  module may call. `waiver-gate.sh` denies any change to a `classify_to:` target and the commit
  gate re-checks it, on the same footing as widening `deps:`/`exports:`, because neither direction
  of a move is obviously "more" and a permission score cannot rank it. **One `classify_to:` is not
  a move: a `defimpl` classifying itself into the boundary of the protocol it implements**, on the
  line straight after the `defimpl` line, naming the protocol as that line writes it. Boundary
  checks nothing an unclassified protocol implementation calls, so that line only narrows, and the
  hook passes it (Giggly's copy of the hook; Tack's stops it). Every `defimpl` here opens with it,
  since each kind of facet, coordinate system, geom, stat and position computes in one. Leaving it
  out compiles in silence, so `test/giggly/boundary_declarations_test.exs` fails on any protocol
  implementation in the app not classified into its protocol's boundary.
- **Disabling a check is pinned by a test, not scored by the hook** (the hook only *lists* one in a
  widening's deny message). `check: [in/out/apps/aliases]`, `dirty_xrefs:` and `top_level?:` are
  the options that make the compiler enforce *less*, and `test/giggly/boundary_declarations_test.exs`
  fails on any of them that is not in its `@sanctioned` list with a stated reason. A test rather
  than a hook because these must be caught on a **first** write, not only on a widening edit — a
  declaration that is too narrow fails loudly, while one that is too wide compiles in silence, so
  nothing else in the toolchain would ever report it. The same test fails the other way on a
  `@sanctioned` entry whose declaration is gone, so a stale permission cannot outlive what it
  permitted: an exemption found unnecessary is deleted from the list, not re-justified.
- **After editing a boundary declaration, `mix compile --force` before trusting the gate.**
  Boundary's incremental state does not fully invalidate when a *declaration* changes: modules that
  do not recompile keep their recorded classification, so the next incremental build can report a
  forbidden reference that no longer exists, or an unused `dirty_xrefs:` entry that is gone. The
  error is in the safe direction — a real violation *is* caught incrementally — so this costs a
  confusing red gate, never a false pass. The same holds when `boundary` itself is bumped.
- **To find what calls into a namespace, ask the compiler — not grep, not xref.** Boundary checks
  calls and struct expansions and skips typespec and alias references, so `mix xref graph` (which
  records typespec edges) over-counts and a text sweep mis-attributes. The probe that works is a
  temporary `top_level?: true, deps: []` on the namespace, which turns every inbound call into a
  forbidden reference; revert it before the gate, which the declarations test enforces anyway.
  `exports: []` does not work: a boundary always exports its own root module, so calls to the
  root — usually most of them — stay legal.
- **`hex.audit` waivers carry a removal condition, not just a justification.** An ignore is keyed
  by advisory **ID, not version**, so it silences that CVE for every future version of the package
  too. And `hex.audit` reports a now-pointless ignore as a *warning* on a step that still exits 0,
  so nothing fails when the waiver expires: it is noticed only by someone reading the gate's
  output, which is another reason never to pipe it. A suspected bad-data advisory is proven from
  the package and the matched OSV record, never from the changelog alone.

## How it works

- Tack's harness is installed with `mix tack.install --profile library`, with `igniter` added to
  `mix.exs` for the run and removed after: `mix igniter.install tack@git:…` cannot take the SSH
  URL, since igniter's `git:` form splits on `@` to read a ref.
- Giggly's copies of Tack-installed files have changed since the install, and a re-install must
  keep the changes: `waiver-gate.sh` counts declarations, so a removed one is a widening, sorts
  paths before hashing an approval, and passes a `defimpl`'s own `classify_to:`;
  `elixir-code-review` scopes its review against the local `main` and adds the mutation step;
  `docs-sync` routes a milestone to one §6 line and mechanism to module documentation.
- The `elixir:` requirement in `mix.exs` is the floor; the **exact** toolchain is pinned in
  `.tool-versions`, which CI reads.
- The gate's tools: `ex_doc`, `credo` (with the `jump_credo_checks` and `ex_slop` plugins and
  the `tack` checks), and `boundary`. Dependency-advisory scanning is Hex's own
  `mix hex.audit` — no scanner dependency. `muex` is a review tool, not a gate step:
  `elixir-code-review` runs it over the changed files.
- **The quality gate's steps** are the `quality_steps` list in `mix.exs`, run in order by
  `mix quality` and, minus the formatting write, by CI's `mix quality --check` — so a step added
  there reaches CI with no second list to keep in sync. Why the less obvious ones are there:
  - `mix format` runs **first**, so an unformatted file is fixed up front instead of surfacing only
    at the trailing `--check-formatted` step after the whole suite has already run.
  - **`mix hex.audit` runs every time**, not just when `mix.exs`/`mix.lock` change: a new advisory
    can be published against a dependency you already have, so an unchanged tree can go from
    clean to vulnerable with no code change. It fails on retired packages as well as advisories.
    Triage a false positive via the `:hex` project key's `ignore_advisories` list in `mix.exs`,
    never by skipping the step. **Requires Hex ≥ 2.5** — older Hex checks retirements only and
    exits 0, so the gate refuses to run under it (`mix local.hex --force` to update).
  - `mix deps.unlock --check-unused` fails when `mix.lock` carries an entry for a package `mix.exs`
    no longer declares. This is the one failure that **cannot** surface locally otherwise: the
    stale `deps/` directory stays on disk, so every other step is happy, while CI fetches only the
    declared tree and finds it missing. Offline and instant; fix with `mix deps.unlock --unused`.
  - Both `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` (in `:dev` and in `:test`) warm the two build dirs; a
    compile warning is a hard failure, matching CI. `mix test --warnings-as-errors` makes a warning
    in any test file fail the gate too, so stray test-file warnings can't pile up unnoticed.
- **Architecture as a compile-time check** (`boundary`): `compilers: [:boundary]` in `mix.exs`
  checks the `use Boundary` declarations, so a forbidden cross-namespace call is a compiler
  warning and therefore a gate failure. The installed shape was the umbrella `Giggly`
  (`exports: :all`), with every `Mix.Tasks.*` classified by hand via `classify_to:`. It is now
  strict everywhere — `boundary: [default: [type: :strict]]` in `mix.exs`, pinned by the
  declarations test, which also fails on any declaration setting `type: :relaxed` — with each
  domain a sub-boundary whose `deps:` is its contract, and a domain that owns an outside library
  a top-level boundary. `mix boundary.spec` prints the current graph. Six constraints govern any
  change to it, each found by compiling rather than by reading the docs: **(1)** `check: [in:
  false]` / `[out: false]` is legal **only on a top-level boundary**, and such a boundary may not
  contain sub-boundaries; **(2)** a boundary with `check.in` false may not be exported from, nor
  listed as anyone's dep; **(3)** a top-level boundary may not name a *sub*-boundary in `deps:` —
  only siblings, its parent, and its ancestors' deps; **(4)** a parent re-exports a
  sub-boundary's modules, and a sub-boundary still lists its exports explicitly, because the list
  is an approval gate; **(5)** strictness belongs to each boundary: a strict parent does not check
  an outside-library call made from a sub-boundary that is not strict itself, which is why the
  default is set once in `mix.exs` rather than on a declaration; **(6)** a sub-boundary may list
  an outside library, or a top-level boundary, only when its parent lists it too — so a library
  listed for one nested domain is open to every module directly in the parent, which is why its
  owner is lifted to the top level instead. The checker ignores plain **alias references** by
  default (`check: [aliases: true]` is off), so passing a module as a value crosses a boundary
  silently; only calls and struct use are caught. And it checks nothing a **protocol
  implementation** calls until the implementation is classified with `classify_to:`
  (`unclassified_protocol_impl?` in its checker; found by compiling a `defimpl` that called a
  module its family does not list), nor any call *to* one.
