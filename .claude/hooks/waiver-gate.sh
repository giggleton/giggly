#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The waiver gate: a new lint or security suppression — or a widened architectural boundary — is a
# decision the user makes, not one the agent slides into while wrapping up.
#
# Why this exists: the day a `System.cmd` call arrives with a credo waiver and a checkable
# "why it is safe" comment, passes the review skill, and is replaced an hour later by
# `Path.wildcard` when the user asks whether the shell-out was needed at all. The review asked
# whether the waiver was justified; nobody asked whether the flagged construct was necessary.
# Prose in a skill did not prompt that question. A hook does.
#
# Two entry points:
#   * `edit` — the PreToolUse(Edit|Write) hook. Reads the tool call on stdin. When an edit ADDS a
#     waiver marker to a code file (`@sobelow_skip [...]`, `credo:disable-for-*`, a hex.audit
#     `ignore_advisories`/`ignore_retirements` entry), it is DENIED until the edit also carries, above
#     each waiver, the two fields that make the decision checkable:
#         # why: <what the code needs that trips the tool, and the invariant that keeps it safe>
#         # instead of: <the alternative considered> — rejected because <reason>
#     With both fields present the hook answers "ask": the harness shows the user the edit and this
#     reason, and the user decides. A headless session turns "ask" into "deny".
#   * `diff` — the commit-gate backstop (called from commit-gate.sh). Scans every changed code file
#     for an added waiver line without both fields in the eight lines above it, so an edit made
#     through Bash/sed cannot bypass the Edit hook. Prints one violation per line; exits 1 if any.
#
# BOUNDARY WIDENING IS DIFFERENT, and deliberately harsher than the waiver rule above: no comment
# satisfies it, and the Edit hook always DENIES so the widening has to be described to the user in
# plain language before anything else happens. See boundary_check/3 for why the gentler designs
# failed. The commit backstop then blocks until `approve-widening` records the user's answer,
# hashed against those exact declarations so a later widening cannot ride along on an earlier yes.
#
#   * `approve-widening` — run ONLY immediately after the user has been shown a widening and has
#     said to proceed. Nothing physically prevents it being run otherwise, exactly as with
#     commit-gate.sh's `mark` commands; the value is that the documented path runs through the
#     conversation the deny forces, so skipping is an explicit act rather than a slide.
#
# Fields rather than free prose because a field is checkable by grep and a paragraph is not, and
# because writing "instead of: X — rejected because Y" is what makes a weak rejection visible in the
# diff. `register_attribute(..., :sobelow_skip, ...)` is boilerplate, not a waiver, and is ignored,
# as is a marker quoted inside a `"""` heredoc — see strip_doc_lines.

# A boundary grant is the same kind of decision as a lint waiver, and fails the same way: widening
# `deps:` or `exports:` to silence a forbidden-reference warning turns the architecture check into
# theatre, and unlike a too-narrow declaration it compiles in silence. The question the hook exists
# to force is "did you widen the declaration, or fix the call?" — almost always the latter.
#
# `check: [in/out/apps/aliases]`, `dirty_xrefs:` and `top_level?:` are NOT counted here; they are
# pinned by the boundary declarations test against a sanctioned list, which catches
# them on a first write as well as an edit.
#
# The count is a permission score over a file's declaration lines, built so that every narrowing
# reads as a decrease and every widening as an increase:
#   * each module named in a `deps: [...]` or `exports: [...]` list scores 1;
#   * `exports: :all` scores 1000 — maximal, since it exports everything there is;
#   * `exports: {:all, except: [A, B]}` scores 999 minus the exclusions, so adding an exclusion
#     narrows and removing one widens, while any `{:all, …}` still scores below a bare `:all`.
# Only the declaration itself is scored, never prose that happens to quote one — see
# boundary_declaration.
#
# The score is a proxy, and it is wrong in one known direction: `exports: :all` scores as
# maximal wherever it appears, but on a boundary nested inside another it makes every module
# unreachable from outside the parent, so replacing it with an explicit list reads as a large
# widening when it is a narrowing. Telling the two apart needs the boundary's place in the graph,
# which this script does not parse — so boundary_caveats says so in the deny message rather than
# pretending the number ranks the change.
#
# It is blind in a second direction: deleting a whole declaration. A boundary exporting only its
# root scores 0, and so does a file with no declaration at all — see boundary_count.
