#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The commit gate: hard-blocks `git commit` until the review and docs passes are recorded for the
# EXACT current working tree, and until every area whose code changed has had its rules file
# looked at.
#
# Why this exists: CLAUDE.md requires the elixir-code-review and docs-sync skills before reporting
# done on any change touching `test/` or a GenServer — and that rule gets skipped
# under wrap-up pressure. A memory is advisory; this hook is enforced by the harness, the same
# reasoning that gives the repo `mix quality` instead of "keep the suite green" as discipline.
#
# Three rules, checked in this order:
#   1. WAIVER GATE — a new lint/security waiver must carry its `# why:` / `# instead of:` lines
#      (waiver-gate.sh documents the fields and enforces them at authoring time; this is the
#      backstop for an edit made through Bash or sed).
#   2. PAIRED PATHS — every `.claude/rules/<area>.md` declares in `paths:` the code it describes.
#      A diff that changes code matching an area's globs without changing that area's rules file
#      is denied unless the docs mark is current, i.e. docs-sync ran against this exact diff and
#      decided the rules needed nothing. Only code changes trigger it: `.md` files and anything
#      under `.claude/` are documentation, so a docs-only commit never has to justify itself. This
#      is the enforced form of docs-sync's "docs update in the same change".
#   3. GATED PATHS — a diff touching test/**, or a `use GenServer` module
#      needs both the review and the docs mark.
#
# Protocol:
#   * `check` — the PreToolUse(Bash) hook entry point. Reads the tool-call JSON on stdin; ignores
#     anything that isn't a `git commit`.
#   * `mark review` / `mark docs` — the skills' final step (and ONLY theirs — see below) records the
#     pass. Marks live under .git/, so they are per-checkout and can never be committed or shared.
#
# A mark is a hash over EVERY changed path and its content (staged, unstaged, untracked, deletions
# included), so editing any file after a pass makes the mark stale on purpose: a follow-up tweak
# owes its own pass ("per change, not per session"). Run `mix format` before marking, so the
# recorded state is the one quality's format step will keep.
#
# Honesty note: nothing can physically stop the agent running `mark` without doing the work — it
# executes the skills too. The gate's value is that the ONLY documented path to a mark is the final
# step of the skill itself, so skipping becomes an explicit act instead of a slide.
#
# Glob matching for rule 2 uses bash patterns, where `*` also crosses `/` and braces are not
# expanded — slightly more permissive than the harness's globs, which errs toward asking for the
# docs pass. Avoid braces in `paths:` globs; `mix tack.rules_check` keeps the globs honest.
#
# Requires `jq` and `git` on PATH.
