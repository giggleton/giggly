# The commit gate: hard-blocks `git commit` until the review and docs passes are recorded for the
# EXACT current working tree, until every area whose code changed has had its rules file looked
# at, and until the last commit's mutation pass is recorded.
#
# Why this exists: CLAUDE.md requires the elixir-code-review and docs-sync skills before reporting
# done on any change touching `test/` or a GenServer — and that rule gets skipped
# under wrap-up pressure. A memory is advisory; this hook is enforced by the harness, the same
# reasoning that gives the repo `mix quality` instead of "keep the suite green" as discipline.
#
# The rules, checked in this order:
#   1. MUTATION — the last commit, when it changed code (`lib/**/*.ex` or `.credo/checks/**/*.ex`,
#      a deleted file aside), must have had the mutation-testing skill's pass over the lines it
#      changed before anything else is committed. A merge needs no pass of its own, nor does a
#      root commit. The rule reads only HEAD, so the last commit of a branch merged with `--no-ff`
#      is held by the after-commit nudge alone. The pass follows the commit because muex's
#      `--since` reads committed history only; this rule makes it follow every time, not only
#      when remembered.
#   2. WAIVER GATE — a new lint/security waiver must carry its `# why:` / `# instead of:` lines
#      (waiver-gate.sh documents the fields and enforces them at authoring time; this is the
#      backstop for an edit made through Bash or sed).
#   3. PAIRED PATHS — every `.claude/rules/<area>.md` declares in `paths:` the code it describes.
#      A diff that changes code matching an area's globs without changing that area's rules file
#      is denied unless the docs mark is current, i.e. docs-sync ran against this exact diff and
#      decided the rules needed nothing. Only code changes trigger it: `.md` files and anything
#      under `.claude/` are documentation, so a docs-only commit never has to justify itself. This
#      is the enforced form of docs-sync's "docs update in the same change".
#   4. GATED PATHS — a diff touching test/**, or a `use GenServer` module
#      needs both the review and the docs mark.
#
# Protocol:
#   * `check` — the PreToolUse(Bash) hook entry point. Reads the tool-call JSON on stdin; ignores
#     anything that isn't a `git commit`.
#   * `post-commit` — the PostToolUse(Bash) hook entry point. After a `git commit`, when `HEAD`
#     needs a mutation pass and has no mark, it tells the agent to run the pass now, naming the
#     commit and its files: a nudge at the moment the pass is due, where rule 1 is what holds.
#   * `mark review` / `mark docs` / `mark mutation` — the skills' final step (and ONLY theirs —
#     see below) records the pass. Marks live under .git/, so they can never be committed or shared.
#     The review and docs marks are per checkout. A mutation mark names a commit, so it lives in
#     the repository's common git dir, shared by every worktree: a commit marked in a worktree
#     stays marked once it is merged.
#
# A review or docs mark is a hash over EVERY changed path and its content (staged, unstaged,
# untracked, deletions included), so editing any file after a pass makes the mark stale on
# purpose: a follow-up tweak owes its own pass ("per change, not per session"). Run `mix format`
# before marking, so the recorded state is the one quality's format step will keep.
#
# Honesty note: nothing can physically stop the agent running `mark` without doing the work — it
# executes the skills too. The gate's value is that the ONLY documented path to a mark is the final
# step of the skill itself, so skipping becomes an explicit act instead of a slide.
#
# Glob matching for rule 2 uses bash patterns, where `*` also crosses `/` and braces are not
# expanded — slightly more permissive than the harness's globs, which errs toward asking for the
# docs pass. Avoid braces in `paths:` globs; `mix tack.rules_check` keeps the globs honest.
#
# Requires `jq` and `git` on PATH.
