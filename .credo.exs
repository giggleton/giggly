# This file contains the configuration for Credo. It was written by `mix tack.install`
# and is yours to edit.
#
# It is evaluated as Elixir (`Code.eval_string/1`), not read as a literal — which is what lets the
# ex_slop check list below come from the package rather than a copy of it. A check's parameter may
# be *derived* from the code the same way; guard any such call with `Code.ensure_loaded?/1` and
# raise, because `mix credo` requires only `loadpaths` and a cold `_build` has nothing to call.
# Inside `mix quality` the question never arises: compile runs before credo.

# The roots `GigglyCredo.Check.PlotRunsNothing` keeps out of `Giggly.Plot`: every protocol Giggly
# defines, each the root of a family of kinds (facets, coordinate systems, geoms, stats,
# positions, guides) that computes or draws; and every module of the guides' namespace that holds
# no struct, since `Plot` lists `Giggly.Guide` to build a legend's struct (`guide_legend/1`) and
# the guides' boundary exports, beside the kinds, the modules that draw the axes, the grid, the
# strips, the plot's labels and the box of legends (design-log §4, the entry beginning "`Plot`
# lists `Giggly.Guide`"). Derived rather than listed, so a family or a drawing module added later
# is covered without a second list to keep in step; it raises on a build with nothing to read, or
# with no protocol or no guide drawing module in it, rather than check against nothing.
