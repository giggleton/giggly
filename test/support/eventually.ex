defmodule Giggly.Eventually do
  @moduledoc """
  Waiting in a test for something asynchronous to become true — the one polling loop the suite uses.

  A test that has to wait (a process to exit, a cast to land) calls `eventually/2`. It polls
  until the condition holds and **fails the test when it never does**: there is no return value to
  forget to `assert` on, and no budget that runs out quietly into a pass.

      import Giggly.Eventually

      eventually(fn -> Registry.lookup(Giggly.Registry, key) == [] end)

      # The truthy value comes back, so a wait doubles as a fetch.
      pid = eventually(fn -> GenServer.whereis(name) end)

  The default budget is one second, polled every 10ms. A condition that is slow on purpose — a
  window that closes on its own clock, a pool that loads over a stubbed network — passes a larger
  `:timeout` where it is called, so the number sits next to the reason for it.

  Why one helper: left alone, a suite grows a hand-rolled loop per file, each with its own budget,
  and some return `false` or `:ok` on timeout and rely on the caller to `assert` — a test whose
  condition never came true can pass. `Tack.Credo.Check.SleepInTest` flags a
  `Process.sleep` in a test file, which is what keeps the next loop from being written.

  This is for a condition that **will** hold. To assert that something does *not* happen — a
  process that must stay dead, a message that must never arrive — there is nothing to poll for;
  use `refute_receive` with a timeout, or a sleep carrying an inline waiver that says why.

  Calls `check` until it returns a truthy value, and returns that value.

  Flunks with `:message` (or a generic one naming the budget) if `check` is still `false` or `nil`
  after `:timeout` milliseconds. `check` is always called at least once, and once more at the
  deadline, so a condition that comes true during the last interval is not missed.
