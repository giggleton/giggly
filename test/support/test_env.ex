defmodule GigglyTest.TestEnv do
  @moduledoc """
  Overriding `:giggly` application config for the rest of one test, and putting it back.

  Application env is one table for the whole VM, outside any database sandbox, so a test that
  changes it owes the suite two things. It must put the old value back, and that is easy to get
  subtly wrong: a key that was **unset** has no old value, and restoring the `nil` that
  `Application.get_env/2` handed back leaves the key *present* with a `nil` in it — which a boolean
  accessor reads as `false` by luck and a `Keyword.get/2` on a module-keyed entry reads as a crash.
  Each function here records the entry with `Application.fetch_env/2`, so "was unset" is remembered
  as such, and its `on_exit/1` either restores the old value or deletes the key.

  And it must run in a **sync** file. ExUnit runs every `async: true` module first and the sync ones
  after, one at a time, and the suite leans on that: an async test may read config because only sync
  files change it. These helpers do nothing to make a change safe under async — nothing could, since
  the table is global — and `Tack.Credo.Check.AsyncEnvMutation` fails the gate on a call to
  any of them, or to `Application.put_env/3` itself, in an `async: true` file.

  Plain functions over `ExUnit.Callbacks.on_exit/1`, so they work from any case template, in a `test`
  body or a `setup` block:

      alias GigglyTest.TestEnv

      setup do
        TestEnv.put_app_env(:feature_enabled, true)
        TestEnv.merge_app_env(Giggly.SomeClient, base_url: "http://localhost:4040")
        :ok
      end

  Several overrides of one key in one test unwind correctly: `on_exit/1` callbacks run last-first,
  so each restores the value the one before it recorded, and the last to run puts back the original.
