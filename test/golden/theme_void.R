# The plot test/golden/theme_void.svg draws, drawn by ggplot2 itself, as ggplot2's own visual
# tests draw their snapshots: the independent check on that golden whenever it changes. The suite
# never runs this; it needs R, ggplot2 and vdiffr, saved as the Docker image
# giggly-r:ggplot2-4.0.3. From the repository's root:
#
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD/test/golden":/golden:ro giggly-r:ggplot2-4.0.3 \
#     Rscript /golden/theme_void.R > theme_void.ggplot2.svg
#
# and compare the two drawings element by element, as test/golden/point.R describes.
#
# mpg's highway mileage against engine size, coloured by fuel, a panel for each drive, in
# theme_void(): no axes, grid lines or backgrounds, the plot's background filled with transparent
# black and no border, so svglite writes no fill; the strips' labels with no margin, no margin round
# the plot or inside the legend, the legend 0.2 centimetres from the panels, and the title and
# subtitle with their margin above them.
#
# First checked with ggplot2 4.0.3 and vdiffr 1.0.9: every element and clip path matches, in
# ggplot2's order, but the background's edge, which R writes as its rounding error.
